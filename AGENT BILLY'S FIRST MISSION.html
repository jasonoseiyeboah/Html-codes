<h1> AGENT BILLY'S FIRST MISSION </h1>

<p> <br> In a city called Suisville there lived a boy called Billy Kingsman. Billy lived with his parents and his brother. He loved 
to listen to music and was good in martial arts. One day his mother told him that his camp will be opened next week so he must get ready. 
Then he went out to buy some camping equipment and while he was going he listened to music. He went to his uncle's shop to buy the 
equipment. He bought equipment like tents, flashlight, fishing poles, sleeping bags and a camping book. <br> <br>

When the time was due for him to go to camp he packed all his items and sat in the bus that will to the camp. When he got there, the 
camp master told him that the camp was a secret hideout used to train intelligent children into agents. He also told him that he has 
been chosen by the agency because of his skills and intelligent. <br> <br>

The next morning, when he woke up, the camp was serving pancakes. So he grabbed his breakfast and went for training. His trainer, Mr 
Jackson demonstrated how the weapons were used apiece. After this they gave him a physical test to find out if he was ready to be an 
agent. When the results came, it shown that he was ready. So they gave him his own weapons, gadgets, vehicles a suit. They also told 
him that his first mission will be on the next day. <br> <br>

The next day, he woke up early so that he can get his mission done early. His mission was to sneak into the lair of a villain called 
Dark Fire. He was going to sneak into the lair because Dark Fire had invented a chemical that will help him take over the world. His 
job was to get a sample so that the agency can find an antidote for it. After they analysed it the results shown that it was very 
dangerous. So they devised a plan to destroy the factory the chemical was made from. Later that day they sent some agents to destroy 
the factory. <br> <br>

After his mission, the next day, when he woke up he saw that the agents were very busy. When he asked one of the agents the agent told                                          
him that "Dark Fire has been sending some of his henchmen to rob the city bank and the police are on it. However we have to catch 
Dark Fire". After he agent was done talking the leader of the agency, Mrs Hall told Billy that he has been chosen to put Dark Fire to 
justice. <br> <br>

After that Billy that Billy went to wear his suit and went to fight Dark Fire. When he went to the city to look for Dark Fire, he saw 
him at the city hall. Then he used his electro ball cannon to blast dark fire but because of dark fire's shield it was not possible. 
So he shot the device that dark fire used to shield himself and used the cannon again. After he defeated dark fire, he took him to 
jail. After his battle with Dark Fire, he went back to the agency and the awarded him agent of the year. The reason was that no one 
has been able to defeat dark fire before. </p>
